# Basic Shell Commands

Bash is a program where you can interactively type commands and receive output. This provides a way to interact with some of the deeper parts of your computer. It is a great place to start when looking to have a deeper technical understanding of computers.

> Bash is a type of program called a Command-line Shell and there are many similar ones. Bash is one that is commonly used, paricularly in Linux. Windows can run Bash via Windows Subsytem for Linux, and the default for macOS is now zsh, which should work with this module. Each Command-line Shell is different but all their concepts are funamentally the same.


```console
~$ echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
```
